# lab-07
This lab was very cool where I had a cool opportunity where I made my very own GitHub Pages site. I setup a repo, cloned it locally, and started building out a little JavaScript file. I also learned how to handle errors better. Then I pushed everything up to GitHub, and I had a live site that I am using now.
