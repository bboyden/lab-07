  This lab was actually very cool — I made my very own GitHub Pages site! I setup a repo, cloned it locally, and started building out a little JavaScript file. I also learned how to handle errors better (which is good because I make a lot of them lol). Then I pushed everything up to GitHub, and boom — I had a live site. Felt super official 🧑‍💻.
